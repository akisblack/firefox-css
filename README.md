# Firefox CSS (For Mozilla Firefox 89+)
### My personal Firefox CSS configuration

## Archived
I no longer use this CSS as I've switched to Firefox-UI-Fix which is much better and maintained properly.

## Imporvements
- Tabs aren't floating
- Tabs have a highlight
- More compact (even more compact than Photon compact!)
- Icons on menu
- UI isn't too small or too big

## Installation
1. Download files
    - Click the green “Code” button above
    - Select "Download Zip”
2. Find your profile directory
    - Open `about:support` in a new tab
    - Find the Profile Folder entry and click the Open Folder button
3. Copy downloaded files
    - Extract the downloaded zip file
    - Create a new directory inside your profile directory called `chrome`
    - Copy the remaining files from the extracted zip-file into previously created the `chrome` directory
4. Firefox Settings
    - Go to `about:config` an enable `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`
    - Restart Firefox
